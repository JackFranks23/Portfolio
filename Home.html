                        Development at CART.
                        I learned a
                        combination of both soft and hard skills there. Which I go over more in the <a class="alink"
                            href="pages/academic.html">academic</a> section, and I share details about my home school,
                        Clovis
                        High. I've had many large projects in my Web App class, including what you're looking at right
                        now.
                        My most important projects from that class, and my Building Info Modeling class can be viewed
                        in the <a class="alink" href="pages/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> section. A few of my essays
                        are also shared in the <a class="alink" href="pages/literature.html">literature</a> tab <br><br>
