        <h2>Clovis High School</h2>

            <p class="half">I'm currently enrolled at Clovis High School. I can't quite say I've enjoyed my time, but
                there were some classes that were I took including Building Information Modeling(Drafting), Construction
                Technology, and Keyboarding. I took Keyboarding my freshman year and its one of the main reasons I have
                such a high typing speed(99 wpm on nitrotype). I then took Construction Technology my Sophomore year
                which helped with my hands on skills and general knowledge regarding construction. I'm taking BIM right
                now in my junior year, in which I've learned how to use tools such as Sketchup and AutoCAD.<br><br>In my
                senior year I'm planning to take AP Gov & Econ and German 2.</p>

        <h2>CART(Center for Advanced Research and Technology)</h2>
        <section class="row">
            <img src="../img/CART.png" class="pimg" alt="Center for Advanced Research and Technology">
            <p class="half left">During my junior year at cart I took the Web App Development class. In this class I learned
                hard skills such as how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(Obviously, you're looking at it). I also
                learned how to use TwinMotion which wasn't extremely useful in the course, but atleast I can use it. My
                time at CART also helped me develop some of my weaker, soft skills such as communication, time
                management and problem-solving. My communication skills were forced to improve due to the amount of
                presentations and group projects we had to do, which I counted to be 7 and 4 respectively.
                Time-management was also a big challenge because of the limited time we had between projects, like the
                one your looking at right now overlapped with the previous one by 4 weeks. My problem solving skills
                also greatly improved thanks to the JavaScript exercises which forced me to come up with solutions to
                each of the required problems.<br><br>Next year at CART I'll be taking Interactive Game Design in which
                I'll continue to develop these skills and hopefully learn even more.</p>

            <p class="half"> Currently I don't know what college or post secondary school I'd like to go to, but I'm
                planning on getting a degree in cybersecurity. I'm also planning to take an internship as an Internet
                Technition the summer after my junior school year.</p>
