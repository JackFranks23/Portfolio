                <h2>Jurassic Park Merch Page</h2>
                <p class="desc">This is the first full sized group project that I completed in my first semester of CART
                    Web App
                    Design. I started the project by making a competitive audit, which is researching competitors in the
                    same market. I chose to research Disney and Amazon which inspired many aspects of our website such
                    as the cart page, navigation bar, and the product pages. I then started the design phase in which I
                    modeled the website using Figma so that the coding portion would be easier. The Jurassic Pay tokens
                    on the website aren't function but the were meant to serve as a universal currency for visitors from
                    any region of the world. The only compromise that I had to make on the website was slightly changing
                    the product pages due to the way the JavaScript worked since it was written before we learned it.

                <p class="desc">
                    This is the first project that I worked on using JavaScript. This project was much more simple than
                    most others but I also had a lot less time. I started by researching other certificate generators
                    and seeing what I liked and disliked about them, so that I could implement it. Then I designed what
                    I wanted my certificates to look like in figma. Finally, I got to work putting the website together.
                    I'm quite happy about how the site turned out, the only thing I wish I changed was changing the text
                    in JavaScript instead of changing the background image.

                <h2>Budget Calculator</h2>
                <p class=desc>This is the solo project that I did my second semester of CART Web App. Before I started
                    the project our class had an EECU representive come to our class and share knowledge in the field of
                    budgeting and managing your finances. After this meeting we were asked to make a budget calculator
                    website based off the pamphlets we used in class. Although the project was finished by myself and
                    all of the ideas and designs were made by be we were tasked to work with others. This project is an
                    excellent display of communication skills because for the first two weeks of programming everyone in
                    the class took turns alternating between working for others and instructing the people working for
                    them. The project managers weren't allowed to write any code ourselves when instructing others which
                    was great for developing communication skills. Later in the development after we finished
                    collaborating we were
                    "thrown a curveball" and asked to implement a Json file with all of the jobs in the EECU handbook,
                    which was the weakest part of my website

                    CART Web App
                    Design. This project was started with the whole class collaborating on a whiteboard to decide what
                    features should be included in a text adventure. We then made two flowcharts, one for the story and
                    one for the javascript. We also used Trello to organize a task list to make a more efficient use of
                    our time. We also wrote a daily dev log to keep track of what work we did each day and what
                    challenges were faced. The majority of making this website was spent coding the javascript since its
                    all user input based. The hardest part was the combat system which had some major bugs that had to
                    be fixed.</p>

                <p class=desc>Mike's Malt Shop was the final project for my Building Information Modeling class first
                    semester. This project was quite simple, I was instructed to follow the guide to making the building
                    to show that I can read drafting blueprints or instructions. The part of the project that was unique
                    to me was designing the color scheme, the background, and the camera position. </p>
