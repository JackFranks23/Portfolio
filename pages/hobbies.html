                <p>The hobby I dedicate the most amount of time to is easily gaming. I started on the ps3 as a kid,
                    moving on to the ps4 when it released, then I switched to using a computer in middle school. Some of
                    the games that I've clocked the most time in are GTA V, Dead By Daylight, Call of Duty, and Payday
                    2. A lot of this time is because these are very grindy games. Some of the games that I really
                    enjoyed but didn't sink as much time into are Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Terraria, and Project
                    Zomboid.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of the digital world two hobbies that I picked up within the last year or so are reading and working out.  Most of the books I read are more focused on self improvement, but I do enjoy a nice science fiction book every now and then.  As for the gym I'm dedicating time every week to go, and I'm spending most of the time on cardio. I was able to bench 135 lbs however.
